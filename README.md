# MLAS
MLAS: Machine learning-based approach for predicting abiotic stress-responsive genes in Chinese cabbage. 

The Sequence.rar file contains the collected protein sequences of Chinese cabbage in FASTA format. 

The features.rar file includes the extracted protein sequence features from the FASTA file. 

The Feature-selection.py file is our Python code for feature selection using the SVM-RFE method. 

The feature-result.py file outputs the results of the feature selection. 

The feature-selected.rar file contains the results after feature selection. 

The metrics.py file is the Python code for pre-training. 

The hyper-param.py file is the Python code for hyperparameter tuning.

The evaluate.py file is the Python code for evaluating the model.
